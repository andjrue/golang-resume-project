# golang-resume-project

### To-Do

- [ ] Create the acutal API!
  -> Will probably need to use Gin for this. Need to read up on the docs.
- [ ] What do we want to add?
- [ ] Will this support POST?
  -> Probably not. If anybody can post, this would get crazy.
- [ ] Eventually deploy this to AWS
  -> I don't want to have this always running on my computer. AWS is the best to place to host it. Will more than likely use API gateway.
